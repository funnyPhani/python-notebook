However, the growing accumulation of plastic and pollutants is posing an enhanced threat to the ocean affecting both marine and human life in the process.Now scientists have devised a new way to identify and track the movement of microplastics in the ocean, a form of tiny plastic that poses a serious threat to the marine ecosystem. Scientists from the University of Michigan have developed a way to spot ocean microplastics across the globe and track them over time, providing a day-by-day timeline of where they enter the water, how they move and where they tend to collect.The study was published in IEEE Transactions of Geoscience and Remote Sensing.Understanding microplasticsMicroplastics are formed when plastic trash in the ocean breaks down from the sun’s rays and the motion of ocean waves. These tiny particles can be carried hundreds or thousands of miles away from the source by ocean currents, making it difficult to track and remove them.An estimated eight million tons of plastic trash enters the ocean each year. Researchers found that the global microplastic concentrations were varying seasonally.The new method uses Nasa's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) that measures wind speeds above Earth’s oceans and provides information about hurricane strength. Using the constellation of eight satellites, the team looked for places where the ocean was smoother than expected given the wind speed, which they thought could indicate the presence of microplastics. It is to be noted that the satellite uses radar to measure ocean roughness and scientists are tapping into this feature.Scientists compared the areas having smoother water with observations and model predictions of where microplastics congregate in the ocean. They found \"microplastics tended to be present in smoother waters, demonstrating that CYGNSS data can be used as a tool to track ocean microplastics from space.\"“We’re still early in the research process, but I hope this can be part of a fundamental change in how we track and manage microplastic pollution,” said Chris Ruf, Professor of Climate and Space Science at the university and senior author of the paper, in a statement released by the University of Michigan.The Great Pacific Garbage PatchResearchers found that the global microplastic concentrations were varying seasonally with peaking in the North Atlantic and Pacific during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. The volume peaked in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a convergence zone in the North Pacific Ocean where microplastics collect in massive quantities during the months of June and July.Meanwhile, concentrations reached their peak in the southern hemisphere during January and February. The researchers produced visualizations that show microplastic concentrations around the globe. Often, the areas of accumulation are due to prevailing local water currents and convergence zones, with the Great Pacific Garbage Patch being the most extreme example.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Brazil to redeploy troops to Amazon to fight deforestation\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/brazil-to-redeploy-troops-to-amazon-to-fight-deforestation-1820791-2021-06-29\nDescription : In 2020, deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon reached a level unseen since2008, according to official data.\n---------------\nBrazil’s president is sending troops back to the Amazon to bolster policing against logging and other illegal land clearance, acting amid international criticism of a surge in deforestation and just two months after withdrawing a similar military mission.President Jair Bolsonaro’s decree calls for soldiers to go to the states of Para, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Rondonia through the end of August. The order, which was published Monday in Brazil’s official gazette, didn’t provide details about the number of troops to be deployed nor the cost of the operation.Vice President Hamilton Mourão told reporters earlier this month that the deployment could be extended beyond two months with the arrival of the dry season, when people burn forest to clear land for farming and ranching.Amazon deforestation had edged upward for several years, then it surged after the 2018 election of Bolsonaro, who repeatedly called for development of the rainforest. The destruction has elicited an international outcry and, more recently, an effort by U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration to urge Bolsonaro to get tough on illegal logging.This will mark the third time that Bolsonaro has dispatched troops to the Amazon, following two “Operation Green Brazil” deployments, the most recent of which ended in April. Each mission involved thousands of soldiers. Still, environmental experts have said the military was ill-prepared and had limited efficacy. Forest fires in Amazon have been another cause of concern in the region. (Photo: Nasa)In 2020, deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon reached a level unseen since 2008, according to official data.And 98.9% of deforestation had indications of illegality, either done near springs, in protected areas or carried out without requisite authorization, according to data released this month by the MapBiomas Project, a network of nonprofits, universities and technology companies that studies Brazilian land use. Brazil’s environmental regulator levied fines in just 5% of these cases, the group found.Márcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups, called the latest military deployment a “smokescreen that will allow the government to claim to be fighting deforestation. He noted a previously successful initiative, largely funded by the Norwegian and German governments, has been suspended since 2019.“The government has adopted a series of measures that simply destroys the state’s monitoring capacity, like stopping environmental fines, Astrini said. He added that the regulator has also ceased destroying machinery used for illegal logging.Bolsonaro’s plan to send soldiers comes as the US. administration has called for curbing Amazon deforestation in order to help arrest climate change. Bolsonaro has said Brazil lacks enough funds to do so on its own, despite the fact the nation did so at the start of this century. A fragment of Amazon rainforest stands next to soy fields in Belterra, Para state, Brazil. (Photo: AP)The U.S. has made clear it would only be willing to contribute once Brazil registers concrete progress, of which there has so far been no sign. Talks between the U.S. and Brazil’s environment ministry have stalled, three Brazilian government officials told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.The decision to deploy troops is partially meant to demonstrate the government’s good intentions to the U.S., one of the officials added.On June 23, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles announced his resignation, giving up his post amid sharp criticism of his tenure and two investigations into his actions involving allegedly illegal timber operations. He has denied all wrongdoing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Planet with more water than Earth discovered during unique cosmic photobomb\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/planet-with-more-water-than-earth-discovered-during-unique-cosmic-photobomb-1820774-2021-06-29\nDescription : The unique planet was discovered as it transited between Earth and its brightstar.\n---------------\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) exoplanet-hunting Cheops satellite has found a third planet in a star system previously believed to have only two planets. The third planet, discovered in a unique photobomb, appears to contain large amounts of water clouds.Astronomers came across the third planet as it moved across the star revealing details of a rare planet “with no known equivalent.” This is the first time that an exoplanet with an orbit of over 100 days has been spotted transiting a star that is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.The star system dubbed Nu2 Lupi is located just under 50 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Lupus (the Wolf) and previous observations had shown two planets orbiting it. The star was named A and the two planets were denoted as planet b and planet c. The newest addition is named Planet d.The exoplanets have masses between those of Earth and Neptune and orbits lasting 11.6, 27.6 and 107.6 days around the star. \"Transiting systems such as Nu2 Lupi are of paramount importance in our understanding of how planets form and evolve, as we can compare several planets around the same bright star in detail,\" ESA quoted the lead author of the study Laetitia Delrez of the University of Liège, Belgium as saying. The Nu2 Lupi planetary system. (Photo: ESA)UNDERSTANDING THE UNIQUE SYSTEMThe newly found planet is unique when it comes to exoplanets with a radius spanning 2.5 times that of Earth and a mass of 8.8 times that of our planet. The amount of stellar radiation (solar radiation) reaching planet d is also mild in comparison to many other discovered exoplanets. Researchers believe that if placed in our solar system, it would be in the orbit between Mercury and Venus.Researchers found planet b to be mainly rocky, while planets c and d appear to contain large amounts of water. \"Planets c and d contain far more water than Earth: a quarter of each planet’s mass is made up of water... This water, however, is not liquid, instead in the form of high-pressure ice or high-temperature steam,\" ESA said in a statement.Talking about habitable conditions, ESA Cheops project scientist Kate Isaak said that while none of these planets would be habitable, their diversity makes the system even more exciting, and a great future prospect for testing how these bodies form and change over time.Researchers studied the data compiled over six observations between April and 6 July 2020 targeting four transits of planet b and three of planet c.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : US Pacific Northwest cities shatter heat records again, life grinds to a halt\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/us-pacific-northwest-cities-shatter-heat-records-again-life-grinds-to-a-halt-1820715-2021-06-29\nDescription : The heat has been attributed to a dome of atmospheric high pressure over theupper US Northwest and Canada, similar to conditions that punished Californiaand southwestern states earlier this month.\n---------------\nThe cities of Portland and Salem in Oregon, and Seattle in Washington set new temperature records on Monday as the Pacific Northwest baked under a heatwave that has shut down much of daily life for residents.In Salem, Oregon's state capitol, temperatures reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47.2 degrees Celsius), the hottest since record-keeping began in the 1890s. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport set an all-time high temperature of 106 Fahrenheit, breaking the record set one day earlier.Portland's airport temperature reached 115 on Monday, breaking the all-time high for the third day in a row. Before setting a record of 112 on Sunday and 108 on Saturday, the previous mark of 107 had not been reached since 1981, the National Weather Service said.\"To put it in perspective, today will likely go down in history as the hottest day ever recorded for places such as Seattle, WA and Portland, OR,\" the National Weather Service said, predicting the heatwave could begin to ease on Tuesday.The heat has been attributed to a dome of atmospheric high pressure over the upper U.S. Northwest and Canada, similar to conditions that punished California and southwestern states earlier this month. Portland, known for rainy weather and sparse sunshine, was especially ill-prepared to handle the high temperatures. Stores sold out of air conditioning units and ice was hard to find. Bars and restaurants closed because kitchen vents could not keep up with the rising temperatures, creating dangerous conditions for cooks.

The state capital of Olympia likewise set a new benchmark high of 105 degrees, exceeding its 2009 record by 1 degree, according to the Weather Service. The heat wave was expected to ease somewhat west of the Cascade range by Tuesday but persist through the week to the east of those mountains, it added.Experts say extreme weather events such as the heatwaves that have descended on parts of the United States this year cannot always be linked directly to climate change.But more unusual weather patterns could become more common amid rising global temperatures, weather service meteorologist Eric Schoening said in an interview this month.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Drier than Sahara desert, Venus clouds cannot support life but Jupiter might\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/venus-clouds-life-jupiter-sahara-desert-nasa-1820700-2021-06-29\nDescription : The new study contradicts previous observations of the presence of phosphinein the clouds of Venus that on Earth is only associated with life.\n---------------\nWith three missions headed towards Venus, the buzz around Earth's mysterious twin is at an all-time high. From studying surface properties to mapping its geological features, scientists are aiming to study how the Earth-like planet turned into a climatic hell.Observations in 2020 had raised speculation about the presence of microbial life in the dense Venusian clouds that obscure the view of the planet's surface. Now, a new study is contradicting the claims stating that the clouds are too dry to support life. However, there are chances Jupiter's clouds might.Published in the journal Nature Astronomy, the study says that the Venus atmosphere becomes too dry for active life above the middle stratosphere. Led by John E. Hallsworth of Queen’s University Belfast, researchers computed the water activity within the clouds of Venus and other Solar System planets from observations of temperature and water-vapour abundance.\"The most extreme life on Earth would stand no chance whatsoever of living in the Venus clouds,\" Hallsworth told Cnet.com adding that the Venus clouds are a whole order of magnitude drier than the Sahara desert. It is to be noted that Sahara has a water activity of 0.25 while Venus clouds are at 0.004. An oblique radar view of the largest block in the Venus lowlands. (Photo: Paul Byrne, based on original NASA/JPL imagery)WHY DID ASTRONOMERS THINK VENUS CLOUDS COULD SUPPORT LIFE?The theory that the clouds could have microbial activity came from an observation by astronomers when they noticed the chemical signature of phosphine, a noxious gas that on Earth is only associated with life, in the clouds in 2020. Two telescopes in Hawaii and Chile spotted the signatures in the thick Venusian clouds.On Earth, there are only two ways phosphine can be formed: One is in an industrial process. (The gas was produced for use as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.) The other way is as part of some kind of poorly understood function in animals and microbes. The astronomers hypothesised a scenario for how life could exist on the inhospitable planet where temperatures on the surface are around 800 degrees (425 degrees Celsius) with no water.The phosphine could be coming from some kind of microbes, probably single-cell ones, inside those sulfuric acid droplets, living their entire lives in the 10-mile-deep, study co-author David Clements, an Imperial College of London astrophysicist had said at the time. The northern hemisphere is displayed in this global view of the surface of Venus. (Photo: Nasa)A SIX-DECADE LONG SEARCHThe idea of life surviving in the clouds of Venus was first proposed by astronomer Carl Sagan and biophysicist Harold Morowitz in 1967 and was later suggested by Mark Bullock and David Grinspoon. Between the years 1962 and 1978, different probes were sent to the planet that showed that about 40 to 43 kilometres up into Venus's atmosphere, it would be possible for the planet to harbour microbial life.While the idea is unique, the presence of high sulfuric acid content in the clouds makes it impossible for microbial activity to sustain. This high sulfuric content makes water activity extremely low in the clouds. A composite view of Jupiter. (Photo: Nasa)JUPITER HAS MORE WATER ACTIVITY THAN VENUSWhile Venus has an extremely low water activity, Jupiter surprisingly has 0.585 water activity, more than Mars at 0.537. The researchers say that this creates conditions for biological activity on the planet, which could be restricted due to other factors.The researchers studying data from Nasa's Galileo spacecraft, which released a probe deep into Jupiter's atmosphere, found that under the massive storms swirling in the atmosphere there are conditions that could support life. While other factors play a role in the sustenance of microbes, the readings are similar to ones found on Earth that are suitable for microbial activity.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Mars may have been habitable for millions of years, finds study\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/life-on-mars-curiosity-rover-nasa-jpl-1820677-2021-06-29\nDescription : Scientists studied samples collected by the Curiosity rover from the Galecrater about 3,700 kilometres away from the Perseverance rover's location.\n---------------\nAs the Perseverance rover begins its journey to look for signs of ancient microbial life in the Jazero crater, a new study of soil samples from the Gale crater has strengthened the possibility that life once flourished on the now-barren Mars.The Gale crater is home to Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is about 3,700 kilometres away from Perseverance's location.Researchers studying the crater said investigations by the Mars Science Laboratory have confirmed the presence of an ancient lake that existed in the Gale crater for up to 10 million years, indicating that parts of Mars may once have been habitable for thousands of years.The report, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, stated that the lake was filled with sediments that eventually converted to a compacted sandstone. Scientists believe that the lake existed about 3.5 billion years ago when the planet had a thicker atmosphere needed to support liquid on the surface. However, it is unclear if the lake had the accurate conditions to support life.The study was conducted using X-Ray data from the Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument (CheMin) onboard the Curiosity rover. It characterised the degree of disorder of clay minerals in the Murray formation at Gale crater. The analysis showed the samples having structural and compositional similarities with clay found in liquid bodies for extended periods of time. Curiosity rover as seen from Space as it moves in Gale crater. (Photo: JPL)The samples, drilled by the Curiosity rover in 2016 from the crater, showed the presence of mineral remnants of glauconitic (iron potassium silicate), suggesting temperatures could have once been stable on the planet, ranging between -3 to 15 degrees Celcius. Glauconite formation takes place in low-sedimentation-rate and open-marine environments on Earth.However, scientists maintained that while glauconitic clay was an indicator of habitability, it does not prove the existence of life. This is not the first such crucial discovery by the rover, which reached Mars in 2012.OTHER DISCOVERIES BY CURIOSITY ROVERPowered by a radioisotope, the rover had also found that that Mars might have organic salts on its surface. Analysing data from the rover, scientists concluded that iron, calcium, magnesium oxalates, and acetates, affected by radiation and oxidation might have decomposed into organic salts in Martian surface sediments. These salts could have been formed by geologic processes or were remnants of ancient microbial life.While the Perseverance rover is looking for ancient microbial life on the surface, the European Space Agency’s forthcoming ExoMars rover, which is equipped to drill down to two meters, will carry an instrument to analyse the chemistry of these deeper Martian layers to better its understanding of the subsurface.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Scientists develop tiny wireless pacemaker that dissolves in the body\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/scientists-develop-tiny-wireless-pacemaker-that-dissolves-in-the-body-1820659-2021-06-29\nDescription : The newly developed device could be an alternative to the traditionalpacemakers that run the risk of infections.\n---------------\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Now, scientists have developed a wireless pacemaker that can dissolve in the body and can be used in patients who require temporary help to regulate heart activity.According to the Global Burden of Disease, nearly 24.8 per cent of all deaths in India are due to cardiovascular diseases. The new pacemaker can reduce this burden and provide immediate help to those who require their heartbeats to be regulated urgently.The leadless battery-free pacemaker also reduces the risk of infection that traditional pacemakers pose due to the use of lead in their manufacturing. Published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers said that the device provided effective pacing of hearts of various sizes in mouse, rat, rabbit, canine and human cardiac models.Also Read: India logs less than 40,000 Covid cases in over 3 months, 907 deaths\"It may serve as the basis for the next generation of postoperative temporary pacing technology,\" the paper said.HOW WAS THE WIRELESS PACEMAKER DEVELOPED?The thin, flexible device is made from materials including magnesium, tungsten, silicon and a polymer known as PLGA, all of which are soluble after undergoing chemical reaction in the body.Weighing less than half a gram, the device regulates the heart by electrical current that is generated through a radio frequency sent from an external device to a receiver within the pacemaker. The pacemaker is inspired by the same technology used in wireless chargers to power smartphones.Also Read: Over 34,000 children tested Covid positive during second wave of pandemic in Assam The implantable, leadless, battery-free cardiac pacemaker.

The pacemakers maintain a normal heartbeat when it beats too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. According to National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, pacemakers send electrical pulses to help the heartbeat at a normal rate and rhythm. Pacemakers can also be used to help heart chambers beat in sync so that they can pump blood more efficiently to the body. This may be needed in the situation of heart failure.The requirement of a pacemaker can be both temporary and permanent. In a temporary situation, it is normally inserted through a vein in the neck and remains outside the body, while in a permanent scenario it is placed in the chest or abdomen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : New device can accurately distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/new-device-can-accurately-distinguish-sars-cov-2-from-other-coronaviruses-1820411-2021-06-29\nDescription : Researchers have developed an easy-to-use and energy-independent device thatcan distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses.\n---------------\nResearchers have developed a tablet-sized device that can distinguish between antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 and four other coronaviruses with 100 per cent accuracy.The team at Duke University in the US demonstrated that the easy-to-use and energy-independent device can reliably detect multiple Covid-19 antibodies and biomarkers simultaneously.The researchers are working to see if the point-of-care device can be used to predict the severity of a Covid-19 infection or a person's immunity against variants of the virus.The platform called \"D4 assay\" can detect Ebola infections a day earlier than the gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, the researchers have shown recently.Read | Current vaccines less effective against Beta variant of Covid-19: StudyThe results, published in the journal Science Advances on June 25, show how flexible the technology can be to adapt to other current or future diseases.\"The D4 assay took six years to develop, but when the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic, we began working to compress all of that work into a few months so we could explore how the test could be used as a public health tool,\" said Ashutosh Chilkoti, a professor at Duke.\"Our test is designed to be both adaptable and truly point-of-care, and this is clearly a scenario when a portable, fast and cost-effective diagnostic would be most useful,\" Chilkoti said.The technology employs a polymer brush coating that acts as a sort of non-stick coating to stop everything except the desired biomarkers from attaching to the test slide when wet.The high effectiveness of this non-stick shield makes the D4 assay incredibly sensitive to even low levels of its targets, according to the researchers.The approach allows researchers to print different molecular traps on different areas of the slide to catch multiple biomarkers at once, they said.The current iteration of the platform also features tiny patterned tunnels that use the physics of liquids to draw samples through the channels without needing any electricity.With just a drop of blood and a biomolecular lubricant, the test runs autonomously in minutes, and can be read with a detector roughly the size of a tablet.\"The detector is battery powered and the test doesn't require any power at all, so you can throw the whole thing into a backpack and truly test at the point-of-care with minimal resources,\" said Jason Liu, a PhD student working in the Chilkoti lab who designed and built the detector.The researchers tested the assay's ability to detect and quantify antibodies produced against three parts of the virus -- a subunit of the spike protein, a binding domain within the protein that grabs on to cells, and the nucleocapsid protein that packages the virus's RNA.Also read | India's 3rd Covid-19 wave 'very unlikely' to be as large as second wave: ICMR studyThe spike protein helps the virus to enter and infect the human cells.The test was able to spot the antibodies in all of the 31 patients tested with severe cases of Covid-19 after two weeks, the researchers said.It also reported zero false-positives in 41 samples taken from healthy people before the pandemic started as well as 18 samples taken from individuals infected with four other widely circulating coronaviruses, they said.The researchers said that the platform's proven accuracy and flexibility make it a prime candidate for developing into other types of tests or for use in future outbreaks.For example, the platform could potentially be able to test whether or not people have immunity to the various strains of SARS-CoV-2 that continue to emerge, they said.\"There are a lot of questions from people about whether or not they're protected from new variants of Covid-19, and our test could answer some of those,\" said Jake Heggestad, a PhD student working in the Chilkoti lab who developed the chip for the test.\"We believe that our platform should be able to distinguish between whether people have antibodies that can neutralise emerging variants of concern or if those antibodies aren't going to be protective against new variants,\" Heggestad added.Live TVWatch | Madhya Pradesh records first death from Delta Plus variant of

https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/covid19-phone-screen-testing-method-vaccine-third-wave-1820360-2021-06-28\nDescription : The Phone Screen Testing (PoST) method can detect coronavirus by taking swabsfrom the screens of your smartphones.\n---------------\nWith Covid-19 testing being one of the key strategies to help curb Covid-19 spread, a new technology can help improve detection of the novel coronavirus using samples taken from the screens of smartphones.The non-invasive and low-cost Phone Screen Testing (PoST) method can be a boon for middle and low-income countries.Researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed samples collected from mobile screens of people using the PoST method. They found that people who tested Covid-19 positive by the regular nasal swab RT-PCR test were also positive when samples were taken from their smartphone screens.The research published in the journal eLife, stated that constant surveillance would be required to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially considering the emergence of new variants that could hamper the effect of vaccination efforts. The researchers said that PoST could help to contain Covid-19 outbreaks and identification of variants of concern in the years to come.WHAT IS PoST?PoST is an environmental test, rather than a clinical test, and researchers claimed that it was both non-invasive and less expensive than traditional RT-PCR. It includes collecting swabs from the screens of the mobile. Once the samples are collected, they are embedded in a saline water solution. The samples are then tested in the same way as other swabs are subjected to in order to establish the virus presence.Also Read: FM Sitharaman announces 8 major relief measures to boost Covid-affected sectorsLed by Dr Rodrigo Young of University College London, the researchers performed the study on 540 individuals who were subjected to both PoST and PCR testing.HOW EFFECTIVE IS PoST METHOD?Using PoST, researchers detected the virus on the phones of 81.3% to 100% of contagious people with a high viral load.\"We successfully identified variations associated with SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants in positive PoST samples,\" researchers said in the paper.Read: Kolkata fake jab scam: Off-site vaccination camps halted, SOP to be issued\"PoST is a new non-invasive, cost-effective, and easy to implement smartphone-based smart alternative for SARS-CoV-2 testing,\" they concluded.A machine is currently under development by Diagnosis Biotech, a Chilean startup founded by Young. Diagnosis Biotech will build on this research, safely taking a phone for PoST sampling and deliver the results directly via SMS to minimise contact.COVID TESTING CURRENTLY IN USEWhile PoST is under development, the different forms of Covid testing currently in use include the Real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test that detects nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens.During the test, a small amount of DNA is extracted through a swab to diagnose the presence of the virus. The swab can be either nasal (through the nose) or oral (through the throat). However, the test is used only for detecting the presence of the virus and it cannot tell if the person has recovered from Covid-19 or not.Also Read: Current vaccines less effective against Beta variant of Covid-19: StudyMeanwhile, the Rapid Antigen testing detects protein fragments specific to the coronavirus. One of the major advantages of the testing is the quick turnaround time for results and in some cases, results can be reported within 15 minutes. The test is considered when the patient is already showing severe symptoms of Covid-19. However, the results have proved to be inaccurate in several cases putting a question mark on its efficacy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : EU countries approve landmark climate change law\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/european-union-climate-laws-paris-agreement-cop26-1820342-2021-06-28\nDescription : The law aims to put climate at the heart of all EU policymaking, ensuringthat future regulations support the emissions-cutting aims\n---------------\nEuropean Union countries on Monday gave the final seal of approval to a law to make the bloc's greenhouse gas emissions targets legally binding, as EU policymakers prepare a huge new package of policies to fight climate change.Negotiators from Parliament and EU member states reached a deal in April on the climate law, which sets targets to reduce net EU emissions by 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, and eliminate them by 205cl0.Ministers from the 27 EU countries formally approved the deal on Monday, except for Bulgaria, which abstained.\"The final compromise does not reflect our national position sufficiently,\" a Bulgarian government spokesman said, without specifying further.Leaders from all EU countries signed up to the 2030 emissions-cutting target in December, which aims to put the bloc on a pathway that, if followed globally, would avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The targets apply to overall EU emissions, rather than a binding requirement for each country. The bill sets targets to reduce net EU emissions by 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, and eliminate net emissions by 2050. (Photo: Reuters)The law aims to put climate at the heart of all EU policymaking, ensuring that future regulations support the emissions-cutting aims.Doing that will require a huge policy overhaul. Most EU laws are designed to meet a previous target to cut emissions by 40% by 2030.The European Commission will begin that upgrade on July 14, when it proposes a dozen policies to reshape industry, energy, transport and housing to emit less CO2. The proposals will include EU carbon market reforms, tougher CO2 standards for new cars, and more ambitious renewable energy targets.Also Read: Explained: What is fusion energy that can meet global clean power demandsThe climate law also requires Brussels to launch an independent expert body to advise on climate policies, and a budget-like mechanism to calculate the total emissions the EU can produce from 2030-2050, under its climate targets.The European Parliament approved the law last week. Parliament and member states will sign the text, a formal step, this week before it becomes law.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : How Perseverance rover clicked this historic selfie on Mars\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/perseverance-rover-selfie-ingenuity-helicopter-nasa-jpl-mars-1820329-2021-06-28\nDescription : Planned over the span of a week, the rover took an hour to click its iconicselfie with the Ingenuity helicopter alongside.\n---------------\nClicking a selfie is probably the most common thing we do in our everyday lives. All it takes is a click and a second. However, things are a little bit different when you are clicking the selfie of a rover 362 million kilometres away on another planet.The April 6 selfie of the Perseverance rover alongside the Ingenuity helicopter will probably go down in history as one of the most iconic images ever clicked. The image ranks in the same file as that of Apollo astronauts walking on the Moon, or that of the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth clicked by Voyager 1 from a distance of six billion kilometres from the planet.The iconic selfie added to an already social-media-savvy rover that had mesmerised us with picture-perfect videos of its landing and deployment earlier.The selfie not only created a worldwide buzz but also allowed engineers to check wear and tear on the rover trundling on a hostile planet. The selfie clicked by Perseverance rover using its robotic arm. (Photo: JPL)HOW DOES A ROVER CLICK A SELFIE?While it takes us just a press of the camera button to click a selfie on Earth, a similar act on Mars required the teamwork of about a dozen engineers, Perseverance drivers, camera operators and image processors.The Perseverance team plotted the event over a span of a week to chart out the commands and sequences to be sent to the rover to move its arm. A total of 62 separate images clicked over the span of an hour were stitched together to make the perfect selfie.Vandi Verma, Chief Engineer For Perseverance Robotic Operation, said the way the rover takes a selfie is a little more complex than the way we do it. The descent and landing of the Perseverance rover has already made it a social-media savvy rover. (Photo: JPL)The rover uses the WATSON camera located on the hand, or turret, at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm. While the camera has been designed to take detailed images of the surface, engineers had to command the rover to take dozens of individual images to produce the selfie.Also Read: In a first, Perseverance Mars rover makes oxygen on another planetSpanned over an hour, the robotic arm moved within a frame to capture 62 images that detailed the Perseverance rover standing tall with Ingenuity helicopter in the rugged background of the Jazero crater. Once the images came down to Earth, image processing engineers assembled the individual frames into a mosaic, which was then warped like a normal camera photo.“The thing that took the most attention was getting Ingenuity into the right place in the selfie. Given how small it is, I thought we did a pretty good job,” Mike Ravine, Advanced Projects Manager at MSSS, said in a statement.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Intense heat wave blisters US Northwest with record temperatures\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/intense-heat-wave-blisters-us-northwest-with-record-temperatures-1820290-2021-06-28\nDescription : The National Weather Service forecasts high temperatures climbing to morethan 30 degrees above normal in parts of Oregon and Washington state.\n---------------\nTemperatures soared on Sunday to an all-time high of 112 degrees Fahrenheit in Oregon's largest city as a record heat wave blistered the Pacific Northwest, sparking a run on ice and air-conditioners, while forcing many restaurants and bars to close.Multnomah County, encompassing the city of Portland, opened 11 emergency \"cooling shelters\", most of them in public libraries, where residents without air conditioning could escape the sweltering heat.\"This is life-threatening heat,\" county health officer Jennifer Vines said in a statement.Governor Kate Brown eased COVID-19 crowd restrictions for theaters, swimming pools and shopping malls ahead of the heat wave. Pools proved a popular choice for many seeking to cool off on Sunday, as did some public fountains.The National Weather Service forecast high temperatures climbing to more than 30 degrees above normal in parts of Oregon and Washington state, a typically temperate region where many homes and businesses have long gone without air conditioning.The extreme heat was attributed to a dome of atmospheric high pressure over the upper US Northwest and Canada, similar to conditions that punished California and southwestern states a week earlier. read moreExcessive-heat warnings were posted across Oregon and Washington, stretching into parts of Idaho, California and Nevada.

While the search for ancient microbial life continues, new research indicates the presence of subsurface ‘lakes' in the Martian south pole.Based on radar signals, researchers have said that many of these lakes might be in areas too cold for water to remain in liquid state. The study carries forward work from 2018 when signals from a radar instrument reflected off the Red Planet’s south pole appeared to reveal a liquid subsurface lake.Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the research states that there are multiple areas throughout the south polar region where the energy reflected from the base is unexpectedly higher than that of the surface. \"Previous analyses of one such region suggested that these stronger reflections could be caused by the presence of an underground lake,\" the paper said.Led by Aditya R Khuller and Jeffrey J Plaut from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the research was conducted by studying radar signals beamed from the European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter flying over the Red Planet. The radar signals were first found in the South Polar Layered Deposits region, which has alternating layers of water ice, frozen carbon dioxide, and dust that has settled there for millions of years. An illustration of the Mars Express Orbiter hovering over the polar region. (Photo: JPL)BEAMING SIGNALS ON THE SURFACEScientists beamed radio waves from the orbiter's Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument, which maps the subsurface layers by peering through the icy layers, on to the surface. Radio waves lose energy in transmission as they pass through material in subsurfaces. They have a weaker signal when reflected back to the spacecraft.However, in some cases, the returning signals were brighter than those from the surface, which was interpreted as to \"imply the presence of liquid water, which strongly reflects radio waves\".Also Read: From creating oxygen to watching first flight: All about Perseverance rover's first 100 days on MarsThe two doctoral researchers studied the data spanning over 15 years taken from the MARSIS instrument onboard the spacecraft that revealed dozens of additional bright reflections over a far greater range of area and depth than ever before. A view of Mars clicked by China's Tianwen-1. (Photo: CNSA)A FROZEN TIME CAPSULEThe radar reflections provide an understanding of the unexplored region and the subsurface layers that have a record of how the tilt in Mars’ axis has shifted over time.

The 140,000-year-old fossilised skull excavated from northeastern China belongs to a previously unknown human species — Homo Longi.Dubbed as \"Dragon Man\" by Chinese researchers, the discovery has opened a new branch in the human family tree as researchers believe the newly found fossil is closely related to modern humans than Neanderthals. \"The completely preserved fossil skull discovered in the Harbin area provides critical evidence for understanding the evolution of humans and the origin of our species,\" researchers said.The research published in three different papers in the journal The Innovation, states that it has recently become clear that several human lineages coexisted with Homo Sapiens during the Middle and Late Pleistocene period. The researchers said that the fossilised skull is one of the most well-preserved human fossils and advances the understanding of previous such finds from the region.Also Read: Misidentified as the smallest dinosaur, fossils from Myanmar is of mysterious Naga lizardsWHAT IS DRAGON MAN FOSSIL?The skull, which is 23 cm long and more than 15 cm wide, is larger than a modern human skull with enough room for a human brain.

(Photo: The Innovation)HOW DID THEY FIND DRAGON MAN?The skull was first found by labourers while building a bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin as late as 1933. Back at the time, the region was governed by Japan and in a bid to safeguard it from falling into Japanese hands, the Chinese labourers wrapped it and hid it in a well, where it remained for over 90 years. The skull was found only after one of the labourers told the story to his grandson in 2018. Once found by the family, the fossil was donated to the Geoscience Museum of Hebei GEO University.Also Read: Fossils from China show new species of extinct giant rhino that roamed AsiaThe team of researchers then conducted a geochemical analysis of the skull and dated it to at least 146,000 years old.

The Hubble team has been working on the payload computer that halted on June 13 as the spacecraft stopped collecting science data.\"The telescope itself and its science instruments remain in good health and are currently in a safe configuration,\" Nasa said in a statement. The problem is adding to the woes of the three-decade-old flying observatory that is soon to be replaced by the James Webb Telescope.Nasa had earlier performed tests on the payload computer on June 23 and June 24, along with switching the backup computer for the first time in space. \"The tests showed that numerous combinations of these hardware pieces from both the primary and backup payload computer all experienced the same error - commands to write into or read from memory were not successful,\" Nasa added.WHAT DOES THE FAULTY COMPUTER DO?The faulty payload computer controls and coordinates the science instruments onboard the spacecraft. Following the sudden halt in the module, the computer stopped receiving a “keep-alive” signal, which indicates that all is well. As soon as the fault occurred, the main computer placed all science instruments in a safe-mode configuration. The Hubble was first deployed on April 25, 1990, by the space shuttle Discovery. (Photo: Nasa)The payload computer consists of a Central Processing Module (CPM), which processes the commands that coordinate and control the science instruments, and a Standard Interface (STINT), which bridges communications between the computer’s CPM and other components. There is also a communications bus, which contains lines that pass signals and data between hardware and an active memory module, which stores operational commands to the instruments.Also Read: Hubble tracks five fast radio bursts to distant galaxies as massive as Milky WayAs the telescope team has already established that the commands to write into or read from memory were not successful, they are looking at other hardware.

The infection caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, a form of coronavirus, has claimed over 3.5 million lives and infected billions.Now, a new research has revealed that nearly 20,000 years ago, the region today known as East Asia was struck by a coronavirus epidemic. The severity of this epidemic was such that it was strong enough to leave some imprints on the human genome and help it evolve.The research was published in the scientific journal Current Biology and was carried out by experts from Australia and the United States.ALSO READ | Not December, first case of Covid-19 could have emerged as early as October 2019: StudyTo understand past epidemics and their impact on humans, the researchers studied genomes of nearly 2,500 people from 26 different population groups in the world.Their analysis revealed that around 20,000 years ago, people living in today's East Asia interacted with coronavirus. According to a report in CNN, this was found to be the earliest interaction of the human genome with coronaviruses and this interaction was strong enough to leave some \"genetic imprints in the DNA of modern-day people in East Asia\".Yassine Souilmi, co-author of the study, said the genomes they studied contain evolutionary information about humans, tracing back hundreds of thousands of years.\"Viruses work by making copies of themselves. However, they don't have their own tools to do the duplication. So, they actually depend on a host, and that's why they invade a host and then they hijack their machinery to create copies of themselves,\" Souilmi was quoted as saying by CNN.It is this \"hijacking\" of human cells by the virus that can leave imprints on the genome.ALSO READ | How does WHO approve Covid-19 vaccines for emergency use?The study authors say, thanks to technological advancements, it is now possible to observe these marks and the analysis has given \"concrete evidence\" that humans were once exposed to coronaviruses and had adapted to them.Analysing the genomes, the researchers found that these genetic signals, indicating prior exposure and adaptation to coronaviruses, were found in people from five population groups in China, Japan and Vietnam.This, however, does not necessarily mean that the coronavirus epidemic that broke out 20,000 years was limited to these three countries.As per Souilmi, it's possible that the epidemic spread to elsewhere too but data to support it is currently unavailable.\"From these populations, Souilmi said the researchers found an affected group developed a beneficial mutation which helped to protect them from the coronavirus. Those with the mutation had an edge in survival, he said -- meaning over time, the population was made up of more people with the mutation than without,\" CNN reported.ALSO READ | Twisting tale of Covid-19 origin, possibly from Wuhan lab: A chronologySpeaking about the impact of this exposure and people's adaptability to it, Souilmi said, \"Over a long period of time, and along the exposure, this leaves a very, very clear marking in the genomes of their descendants.\"Meanwhile, issuing a warning note, evolutionary biologist Dr David Enard from the University of Arizona, who led the study, told the New York Times (NYT) that these findings should \"make us worry\".\"What is going on right now might be going on for generations and generations,\" he was quoted as saying by NYT.In its report on the study, NYT said the researchers have estimated that the genes of people exposed to coronavirus in East Asia evolved their antiviral mutations between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. This evolution was most likely over the course of a few centuries.\"It's a surprising finding, since East Asians at the time were not living in dense communities but instead formed small bands of hunter-gatherers,\" the report said.ALSO WATCH | Tracing the Covid virus origin: What is the truth of Wuhan?\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : NHS England to pilot blood test that detects more than 50 cancers\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/nhs-england-pilot-blood-test-50-cancers-1819766-2021-06-26\nDescription : England's National Health Service (NHS) is scheduled to a launch pilot testof a blood test, developed by US-based company Grail, that can detect 50types of cancer at early stages. The scheme will be launched in autumn and isaimed at people over 50 years of age with high risk of cancer.\n---------------\nA screen testing for blood test that can detect 50 types of cancer at early stages is to be rolled out by England's National Health Service (NHS). This pilot scheme will be launched in autumn and is aimed at people over 50 years of age with a high risk of cancer.Grail, a US-based company, has developed this test using the method-machine learning algorithm, a kind of artificial intelligence that looks for chemical changes in fragments of genetic code cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that leak from tumours into the bloodstream. The study was conducted on 2,823 people with the disease and 1,254 people without it.Eric Klein, Managing Director and Chairman of Cleveland Clinic’s Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute, said in a podcast, “We have established screening paradigms for five cancer, cervical cancer, cervical swabbing and cytology, prostate cancer with PSA, colon cancer with Cologuard and colonoscopy, breast cancer with mammography and lung cancer screening for patients at high risk with CT scanning, although it's underutilised, but there are a whole lot of other cancers that there are no screen paradigms for that tend to present in late stages and are hard to cure.”Nikki Menon, a 36-year-old breast cancer survivor based in South London told India Today, “This sounds like a blessing. Particularly to those people who have a family history and are worried for themselves and family members. As a cancer survivor, I fully acknowledge that early detection is the key to tackle this growing illness and if the accuracy of this test is verified, we are in good hands.”Also Read: Rise in Delta variant cases worry UK residents, experts hopeful of AstraZeneca vaccineTests like these will be a very useful tool that can provide peace of mind. “If I have an offspring, I would definitely avail this test,” said Nikki Menon.According to the World Health Organisation, cancer is a leading cause of deaths worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million lives in 2020. In England, around half of cancer cases are currently diagnosed at stage one or two but the NHS Long Term Plan is aiming to increase that to three quarters by 2028.Chemotherapy has been tough for 50-year-old Tammy. While getting ready for surgery for her ovarian cancer, she feels it would have been a blessing if this test was available and the condition could be detected earlier.Michelle Mitchell, chief executive at Cancer Research UK, in a statement told India Today, “This technology has potential but what doctors need is to detect cancer at the very earliest stages, because we know that this gives patients the best chance of survival. The results from this study do not yet tell us whether this test is able to pick up early-stage cancers in people who have not already been diagnosed.”“A simple, reliable test for detecting cancer is sorely needed and would save many lives, and a crucial step towards turning this potential into reality will be a large-scale clinical trial which we know is in the works, giving the test to people who have not been diagnosed with cancer. This is the only way we’ll see if the test can help detect cancers before the currently available diagnostic methods do,” she added.NHS Chief Executive Sir Simon Stevens said, “While the good news is that cancer survival is now at a record high, over a thousand people every day are newly diagnosed with cancer. Early detection, particularly for hard-to-treat conditions like ovarian and pancreatic cancer, has the potential to save many lives. This promising blood test could therefore be a game-changer in cancer care, helping thousands more people to get successful treatment.\"NHS pilot test will be rolled out to about 140,000 participants while the results are expected by 2023.Also Read: UK records 9,055 new Covid-19 cases, highest since February\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : US govt's UFO report can’t explain sightings, does not rule out extra-terrestrial origin\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/ufo-report-can-not-explain-sightings-extra-terrestrial-origin-not-ruled-out-1819613-2021-06-26\nDescription : The report marked a turning point for the US government after the militaryspent decades debunking and discrediting observations of UFOs and \"flyingsaucers\" dating back to the 1940s.\n---------------\nA US government report on UFOs issued on Friday said defence and intelligence analysts lack sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects observed by American military pilots including whether they are advanced earthly technologies, atmospherics or of an extra-terrestrial origin.The unclassified nine-page report, released to Congress and the public, encompasses 144 observations -- mostly from US Navy personnel -- of what the government officially calls \"unidentified aerial phenomenon,\" or UAP, dating back to 2004.Labelled a preliminary assessment, it was compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in conjunction with a Navy-led task force created by the Pentagon last year.ALSO READ | The Tic Tac incident: Retired US Navy pilot recalls encounter with UFOs day before US govt's report\"UAP clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to US national security,\" the report stated, adding that the phenomena \"probably lack a single explanation.\"A WATERSHED MOMENTThe report marked a turning point for the US government after the military spent decades deflecting, debunking and discrediting observations of unidentified flying objects and \"flying saucers\" dating back to the 1940s.The report includes some UAP cases that previously came to light in the Pentagon's release of video from naval aviators showing enigmatic aircraft off the US East and West Coasts exhibiting speed and manoeuvrability exceeding known aviation technologies and lacking any visible means of propulsion or flight-control surfaces.All but one of the listed sightings - an instance attributed to a large, deflating balloon - remain unexplained, subject to further analysis, the report said. For the other 143 cases, the report found that too little data exists to conclude whether they represent some exotic aerial system developed either by a US government or commercial entity, or by a foreign power such as China or Russia.In some observations, UAP appeared to exhibit \"unusual patterns or flight characteristics,\" but those may stem from sensor glitches or witness misperceptions and \"require additional rigorous analysis,\" the report said.WATCH | UFO sighted hovering over ocean, vanishing into water in leaked US Navy videoAnalysts have yet to rule out an extra-terrestrial origin, senior US officials told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The report's language avoided explicit mentions of such possibilities.Asked about potential alien explanations, one of the officials said: \"That's not the purpose of the task force, to evaluate any sort of search for extra-terrestrial life. ... That's not what we were charged with doing.\"\"Of the 144 reports we are dealing with here, we have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them - but we will go wherever the data takes us,\" the senior official added.NEAR MISSESThe study documented 11 UAP near-misses reported by pilots and a small number of cases in which military aircraft \"processed radio frequency energy associated with UAP sightings.\" Most reports also described objects that interrupted training or other US military exercises, it stated.The task force focused on phenomena witnessed first-hand by military aviators, with 80 reports involving detection by multiple sensors, the report said. Most were from the past few years.ALSO READ | Aliens would be friendly but reaching out a terrible idea: Theorist Michio KakuThe report established five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or American industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems and a catch-all \"other\" category.The senior official said the findings did not provide any \"clear indications\" that the UAP are part of a foreign intelligence-collection program or a major technological advancement by a potential adversary.FORMALIZING PROBE INTO UAPsThe government in recent years has adopted UAP as its term for what commonly are known as \"unidentified flying objects,\" or UFOs, long associated with the notion of alien spacecraft.US Senator Marco Rubio was instrumental in commissioning the report, ordered by Congress six months ago as part of broader intelligence legislation.\"For years, the men and women we trust to defend our country reported encounters with unidentified aircraft that had superior capabilities, and for years their concerns were often ignored and ridiculed,\" Rubio said. \"This report is an important first step in cataloguing these incidents, but it is just a first step.\"After the report's release, the Pentagon announced plans to \"formalize\" its UAP investigation mission currently handled by the task force.Mick West, a UFO sceptic and researcher, said the \"report points largely at boring explanations, even including birds and balloons, and identified some areas where we need to improve our data gathering.\"It is not the first official US report on UFOs. The US Air Force conducted a previous investigation called Project Blue Book, ended in 1969, that compiled a list of 12,618 sightings, 701 of which involved objects that officially remained \"unidentified.\"In 1994, the Air Force said it completed a study to locate records relating to the 1947 \"Roswell incident\" in New Mexico. It said materials recovered near Roswell were consistent with a crashed balloon, the military's long-standing explanation, and that no records indicated that there had been the recovery of alien bodies or extra-terrestrial materials.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : The Tic Tac incident: Retired US Navy pilot recalls encounter with UFOs\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/us-government-report-on-ufos-fails-to-determine-extraterrestrial-links-1819598-2021-06-26\nDescription : Retired US Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich and her then-commandingofficer had noticed \"a smooth, white oblong object resembling a large Tic Tacbreath mint flying at high speed over the water\" during a routine trainingmission in 2004.\n---------------\nA day before a long-talked-about report on UFOs was released by the US government, a retired Navy officer recalled her encounter with an unidentified flying object.Retired US Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich received some meida attention due to her personal experience with UFOs. \"I don't consider myself a whistle blower ... I don't identify as a UFO person,\" Reuters quoted the former pilot as saying.During a routine training mission in 2004, Dietrich and her then-commanding officer had noticed an unusual \"churning\" of the ocean surface before seeing \"a smooth, white oblong object resembling a large Tic Tac breath mint flying at high speed over the water.\"Retired Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich was among several aviators from aircraft carrier USS Nimitz involved in a 2004 encounter with an unknown aircraft. As the U.S. government prepares to issue a report on UFOs, Dietrich recalls her experience https://t.co/pINcdXMFsh pic.twitter.com/19IQpgcpNB— Reuters (@Reuters) June 25, 2021When they tried to engage with the object, \"it appeared to respond in a way that we didn't recognize\" because it seemed to lack \"any visible flight control surfaces or means of propulsion,\" Dietrich recounted.\"We don't know what it was, but it could have been a natural phenomenon in human activity. But the point was that it was weird, and we couldn't recognize it,\" she said.Lack of data to prove extraterrestrial originMeanwhile, the report on UFOs, issued by the US government on Friday, failed to mark any specific reason or cause behind the sighting of unidentified flying objects. The researchers concluded that they lacked sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying materials.In the unclassified nine-page report, which was released to Congress and the public, the investigators did not find any extraterrestrial links while reviewing 144 sightings of aircraft or other devices - mostly by US Navy personnel.“It’s clear that we need to improve our capacity to further analyze remaining UAP observations, even as we accept that there are some limits to our capacity to characterize and understand some of the observations that we have,” one official said as quoted by the news agency Associated Press.Reportedly, in 18 cases, witnesses saw “unusual” patterns of movement or flight characteristics. But the report failed to conclude if those sightings had an extraterrestrial connection, saying that more analysis was needed on the matter. However, the analysts did not completely rule out extraterrestrial origins either.On being asked about any possible connection with \"aliens\", one of the officials said, \"That's not the purpose of the task force, to evaluate any sort of search for extraterrestrial life. That's not what we are charged with doing.\"ALSO READ: No evidence of aliens, but...: US intel report on UFOsThe report, however, has marked a turning point for the US government after its military and other defence organisations spent years researching unidentified flying objects and saucers - which the government officially calls unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) - since the 1940s.Once a domain of science fiction and \"ufologists\", the subject of UAPs - especially UFOs - has attracted the attention of the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies in recent years.US Senator Marco Rubio, one of the instrumental forces in commissioning the report, said, \"For years, the men and women we trust to defend our country reported encounters with unidentified aircraft that had superior capabilities, and for years their concerns were often ignored and ridiculed. This report is an important first step in cataloging these incidents.\"Among the 144 sightings that were reviewed, only one has been categorised as \"airborne clutter”. It is believed to be a large deflating balloon. The rest remained uncategorised due to lack of appropriate data and information.The report listed five potential categories for the UAPs, including the possibility of foreign adversaries using unknown technology to fly unidentified objects into US territory.The Department of Defense will now develop a new strategy to collect information on potential sightings of UFOs over the next three months.“It is critical that the United States maintain operations security and safety at DoD ranges,” Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks wrote in a memo released Friday.She added, “To this end, it is equally critical that all U.S. military aircrews or government personnel report whenever aircraft or other devices interfere with military training. This includes the observation and reporting of UAPs.”ALSO READ: Stalk aliens near you with this map: 10 UFOs spotted in India\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Europe's Space Agency to hire first disabled astronaut\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/-space-is-for-everyone-europe-s-space-agency-to-hire-first-disabled-astronaut-1819567-2021-06-26\nDescription : \"Space is for everyone,\" European Space Agency (ESA) chief Josef Aschbachersaid while announcing the launch of the world's first physically disabledastronaut.\n---------------\nThe European Space Agency hopes to hire and launch the world's first physically disabled astronaut and several hundred would-be para-astronauts have already applied for the role, ESA head Josef Aschbacher told Reuters on Friday.The 22-member space programme has just closed its latest decennial recruitment call for astronauts and received 22,000 applicants, Aschbacher said.\"We would like to launch an astronaut with a disability, which would be the first time ever,\" the Austrian added. \"But I'm also happy for ESA because it shows that space is for everyone, and that's something I'd like to convey.\"The ESA, whose Ariane rocket once dominated the market for commercial satellite launches, faces ever stiffer competition from tech-funded upstarts like Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX.Read | Europe seeks disabled astronauts, more women in spaceAmazon founder Bezos hopes next month to become the first man to go into space on his own rocket, highlighting the growing role tech billionaires are playing in a field that was once dominated by public agencies.\"Space is developing extremely fast and if we don't catch up with this train we are left behind,\" he added, outlining plans to refashion the agency as a more entrepreneurial player ready to work with venture capitalists to help grow European start-ups that could one day rival the Silicon Valley players.The challenges are immense: the ESA's 7 billion euro budget is a third of NASA's, while its seven or eight launches a year are dwarfed by the 40 carried out by the United States.Read | The final frontier: Solving the challenge of doing laundry in spaceAschbacher, who grew up staring at the stars above his parents' mountain farm in Austria, himself once applied to become an ESA astronaut when he was a student. But what was once a geeky, niche enthusiasm has now become mainstream, he said.This year's job ad attracted almost three times the 8,000 applications received a decade ago, and a quarter of them were women, up from just 15 per cent before. The ESA has promised to develop technologies to ensure those with disabilities, like shortened legs, play a full part.And those astronauts will go beyond the International Space Station: some will deploy to the United States's planned Gateway station on the moon, while the ESA's member states are considering an invitation from Chinese and Russian space agencies to participate in their similar moonbase project.Could European astronauts one day be serving simultaneously on two different moonbases at once?\"The invitation is on the table, and it's a very nice idea,\" he said.Read | From creating oxygen to watching first flight: All about Perseverance rover's first 100 days on Mars\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Virgin Galactic gets FAA’s approval to launch customers to space\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/virgin-galactic-gets-faas-approval-to-launch-customers-to-space-1819500-2021-06-25\nDescription : Virgin Galactic finally has the Federal Aviation Administration’s approvalto start launching customers into space from New Mexico.\n---------------\nVirgin Galactic finally has the federal government’s approval to start launching customers into space from New Mexico.Richard Branson’s rocketship company announced the Federal Aviation Administration’s updated license on Friday.It’s the final hurdle in Virgin Galactic’s yearslong effort to send paying passengers on short space hops.The company is working toward three more space test flights, with the next one this summer. The original plans called for Branson to be aboard a test flight later this year, with flights for paying customers beginning next year.Blue Origin’s Jeff Bezos plans to ride his own rocket into space July 20 from Texas.“I appreciate that there is a lot of speculation” over whether Branson will try to beat Bezos into space, company spokeswoman Valerija Cymbal said in an email. “But we don’t have any announcements about Virgin Galactic’s future flight plans at this time.”Watch | Virgin Galactic completes first flight in over two yearsUnlike Blue Origin’s and SpaceX’s capsules launched from the ground by reusable rockets, Virgin Galactic uses a winged spacecraft that launches from the belly of an airplane. It’s reached space three times since 2018 with two pilots in the cockpit. The second trip carried a third company employee.A review of the company’s third flight to space in May — which reached an altitude of 55 miles (89 kilometers) — showed everything went well and paved the way for the necessary FAA permission.“Today’s approval by the FAA of our full commercial launch license, in conjunction with the success of our May 22 test flight, give us confidence as we proceed toward our first fully crewed test flight this summer,” chief executive officer Michael Colglazier said in a statementMore than 600 people already have reserved a ride to space. Tickets initially cost $250,000, but the price is expected to go up once Virgin Galactic starts accepting reservations again.Blue Origin has yet to sell tickets to the public or say what it will cost.

However, the one thing it hasn't been able to do is to look at the time when the first stars of the universe began to shine. A time just after the Big Bang.Astronomers have now calculated the time when the first stars began shining.Known as cosmic dawn, the event occurred nearly 250 to 350 million years after the Big Bang and astronomers have calculated that they will be able to see the birth of these first stars as early as next year.Also Read: Hubble tracks five fast radio bursts to distant galaxies as massive as Milky WayAS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR?Yes! As early as 2022.Astronomers are hopeful that the James Webb Telescope, scheduled to be launched later this year, will be able to look back in time and witness the beginning of the universe with the birth of these first stars powered by nuclear fusion. Our Sun is one such star that formed after the Big Bang. (Photo: Nasa)Astronomers estimate that the universe came into existence nearly 13.8 billion years ago but it remained quiet and dark for a few million years after which hydrogen gas that filled the expanse came together under the effect of gravity to reach such high temperatures that it led to fusion reactions and the first stars (like our Sun) came into existence.In a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, an international team of astronomers described how they used images from the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes to examine six of the most distant galaxies, light from which have taken most of the universe’s lifetime to reach us. The researchers combined those observations with images from the ground-based Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA), the European Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Gemini South and twin Keck telescopes in Hawaii to calculate the distance that took light nearly 13 billion years to reach us.Astronomers believe that the birth of stars was a gradual process taking place one after another instead of a coordinated explosion. \"We found that the ages of the six galaxies we looked at were slightly different, so they didn’t all switch on at once. We now eagerly await the launch of the James Webb space telescope. It has got seven times the light-gathering power of Hubble and extends further into the infrared, which is crucial for going back further in time,” Prof Richard Ellis at University College London told The Guardian. James Webb Telescope is scheduled to be launched in October this year. (Photo: Nasa)JAMES WEBB TELESCOPE TO FIND COSMIC DAWNThe James Webb Telescope will replace the vintage Hubble Space Telescope that has so far acted as our binoculars into the journey of the cosmos. The telescope is likely to be launched on October 31, Nasa had said. Once up and running, it will offer a unique opportunity to study the origins of the universe. \"The telescope will examine every phase of cosmic history: from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets to the evolution of our own solar system,\" Nasa said.The key goals of the telescope include looking back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe, help astronomers compare the faintest, earliest galaxies to today's grand spirals and ellipticals, and see right through into massive clouds of dust where stars and planetary systems are being born.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle : Strawberry Moon 2021: Check out stunning images of the last super moon of the year\nUrl : https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/strawberry-moon-2021-check-out-stunning-images-of-the-last-super-moon-of-the-year-1819295-2021-06-25\nDescription : The Strawberry Moon marks the last Full Moon of the spring season and thefirst Full Moon of the summer.

The first dinosaur discoverywas made there in the 1960s by a petroleum geologist.\n---------------\nFossils from tiny baby dinosaurs discovered in northernmost Alaska offer strong evidence that the prehistoric creatures lived year-round in the Arctic and were likely warm-blooded, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology.The fossils are from at least seven types of dinosaurs just hatched or still in their eggs about 70 million years ago. Researchers have never found evidence of dinosaur nests so far north, said lead author Pat Druckenmiller, director of the University of Alaska Museum of the North.The find helps upend past assumptions of dinosaurs as giant cold-blooded reptiles.\"If they reproduced, then they over-wintered there. If they overwintered there, they had to deal with conditions that we don't usually associate with dinosaurs, like freezing conditions and snow,\" Druckenmiller said.To survive dark Arctic winters, those dinosaurs could not have basked in the sun to warm their bodies, as lizards do, he said. \"At least these groups had endothermy,\" he said, using the term for the ability of animals to warm their bodies through internal functions. \"They had a degree of warm-bloodedness.\"The discovery site is a steep bluff on the Colville River on Alaska's North Slope, at latitude 70 and about 250 miles (400 km) north of the Arctic Circle. In the Cretaceous period, when North America was positioned differently, it was even farther north, at latitude 80 or 85, Druckenmiller said.READ: Dinosaur bones dating back to 100 million years found in MeghalayaThe region was much warmer then than Alaska's North Slope is now but hardly tropical. From remnants of ancient plants, scientists calculate the average annual temperature at about 6 degrees Celsius (42.8 Fahrenheit) similar to Juneau, Alaska meaning below-freezing winters with snow, Druckenmiller said. The fossils are from at least seven types of dinosaurs just hatched or still in their eggs about 70 million years ago. (Photo: Getty/Representative)While Alaska's North Slope endures two months of total winter darkness now, during the Cretaceous period it was in total darkness for up to four months a year, he said. Finding the tiny bones and teeth, some the size of a pinhead, was laborious, Druckenmiller said. They were identified through microscopic examination after being sifted out multiple times from sediments collected in expeditions stretching back decades, he said. \"I liken it to gold panning. It's a very slow process,\" he said.The discovery site, called the Prince Creek Formation, has proved crucial to modern understanding of the ancient creatures. The first dinosaur discovery was made there in the 1960s by a petroleum geologist. Subsequent expeditions found previously unknown dinosaur species.
